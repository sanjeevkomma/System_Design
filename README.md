# System Design Basics
* vertical scaling: optimise precision and increase through put with the same resources 
* preprossing (e.g cron job) : prepare before hand during non pick hours 
* Backups: keep backups and avoid single point of failure 
* horizontal scaling: get more resources 
* micro service architecture 
* distributed system (partioning)
* load distribution 
* Decoupling 
* Logging 
* Extensible
