# Table
| #Principle  | #Usage |
| :---: | :---: | 
| [Single Responsibility Principle](https://stackify.com/solid-design-principles/) | One Class & One Functionality. A class should have one, and only one, reason to change |
| [Open/Close Principle](https://stackify.com/solid-design-open-closed-principle/) | Method / Object / Class / Module should be open for extension, but closed for modification |
| [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://stackify.com/solid-design-liskov-substitution-principle/) | Objects should be replaceable by their subtypes |
| Interface Segregation Principle | Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use |
| [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://stackify.com/dependency-inversion-principle/) | 1. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions 2. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions |
