# J2SE Design Patterns
# Creational Design Pattern
| #Design Pattern  | #Intent |
| :---: | :---: | 
| Factory Pattern | 1. creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. 2). refers to the newly created object through a common interface  |
| Abstract Factory Pattern | Abstract Factory offers the interface for creating a family of related objects, without explicitly specifying their classes |
| Singleton Pattern | 1. Ensure that only one instance of a class is created 2). Provide a global point of access to the object |
| Prototype Pattern | 1. specifying the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance 2). creating new objects by copying this prototype |
| Builder Pattern | 1. Defines an instance for creating an object but letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate 2). Refers to the newly created object through a common interface |

# Structural Design Pattern
| #Design Pattern  | #Intent |
| :---: | :---: | 
| Adapter Pattern |1. Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect 2). Adapter lets classes work together, that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces  |
| Bridge Pattern | The intent of this pattern is to decouple abstraction from implementation so that the two can vary independently  |
| Composite Pattern |1. The intent of this pattern is to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies 2. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly  |
| Decorator Pattern | The intent of this pattern is to add additional responsibilities dynamically to an object |
| Facade Pattern |  |
| Flyweight Pattern | The intent of this pattern is to use sharing to support a large number of objects that have part of their internal state in common where the other part of state can vary |
| Proxy Pattern |The intent of this pattern is to provide a Placeholder for an object to control references to it  |
