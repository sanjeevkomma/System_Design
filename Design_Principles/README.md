# To Read
* The Open/Close principle is mainly used to prevent regression and ensure backward compatibility

# Terminology
* Composition = part-of relationship
* Inheritance = is-a relationship
* Aggregation = has-a relationship
* Association = Composition is a strong Association & Aggregation is a weak Association


# Table
|#SNo| #Principle  | #Intent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
|1 | [Single Responsibility Principle](https://stackify.com/solid-design-principles/) | One Class & One Functionality. A class should have one and only one reason to change |
|2| [Open/Close Principle](https://stackify.com/solid-design-open-closed-principle/) | Method / Object / Class / Module should be open for extension, but closed for modification |
|3| [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://stackify.com/solid-design-liskov-substitution-principle/) | 1. Derived types must be completely substitutable for their base types 2. Objects should be replaceable by their subtypes. For example, if we have a Car object, it can be used in the code as a Vehicle 3. The derived types must not change the behavior of the base types |
|4| [Interface Segregation Principle](https://stackify.com/interface-segregation-principle/) | Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use |
|5| [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://stackify.com/dependency-inversion-principle/) | 1. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions 2. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions |
|6| DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle | Don't write the same code repeatedly |
|7| KISS(Keep It Simple, Stupid) Principle | To keep the code simple and clear, making it easy to understand |
|8| Composition Over Inheritance Principle | Use part-of relationship over is-a relationship |
